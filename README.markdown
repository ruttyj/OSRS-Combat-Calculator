# OSRS Combat Calculator - Vue Composition API (Work in progress)

This is an experiment to test out the new Vue Composition API which will offically be released with VueJS 3.0. 

To test this out I am implementing a Combat level calculator for an oldschool version of the classic game "Runescape".

Features currently include:
- Calculation of combat level
- Conversion to XP to level and vice versa
- Calculation to maximize meele or ranged skills without increasing combat level
- Use of skill presets
- Local storage of custom presets
- Graph to display the combat specs
